TASK #4 - To explore Decision Tree Classifier

In this task, we have to build the Decision Tree Classifier for the 'Iris' dataset and visualize it. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.

Solution: The solution for the above mentioned task is in the filed named "Task #4 - Decision Tree Classifier". The Decision Tree Classifier for the given dataset can be created using the 'sklearn' package. I have performed various visualizations for better understanding of the given dataset and the Decision Tree created using the 'yellowbrick' library.

Thank you.
