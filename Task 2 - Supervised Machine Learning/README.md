TASK #2 - To explore Supervised Machine Learning

In this regression task, we will predict percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables..
Data can be found at "http://bit.ly/w-data"

What will be the predcted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs in a day?


Solution:

The solution for the above mentioned task is in the file named "Task #2 - Predict percentage.ipynb".
I have used the library named 'turicreate' for the creation and training of the machine learning model required to solve this problem. The answer to the final question mentioned has also been calculated in it.

Thank you.
