TASK #3 - To explore Unsupervised Machine Learning

In this Clustering task, we have to predict the optimum number of clusters from the given 'Iris' dataset and represent them visually.
Dataset: https://drive.google.com/file/d/11Iq7YvbWZbt8VXjfm06brx66b10YiwK-/view?usp=sharing

Solution: The solution for the above mentioned task is in the filed named "Task #3 - Predict and Represent Clusters".I have used the library 'sklearn' for solving this problem. 'The Elbow Method' is used for the prediction of the optimum number of clusters for the given dataset. Clustering is then performed on the data to classify the given data into the predicted optimum number of clusters. The clusters and their respective centroids are then represented visually with different colours using the 'Matplotib' library.

Thank you.
